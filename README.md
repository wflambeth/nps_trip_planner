# National Parks Trip Planner

This was a collaboration with three (then-)strangers for the Fall 2022 Beaverhacks Hackathon. We chose to work on a straightforward frontend for the National Parks Service API, which provides real-time information on the USA's many national parks. 

Several members of our team were very new to programming, so we approached this as a learning experience for them first and foremost, making sure all members were involved in both design and implementation. The final product allows users to select any national park and view its location and driving directions, as well as information on current visitor alerts and upcoming events. 

Our project was awarded the "Social Good Award" by the hackathon judges, netting us some Amazon gift cards!
